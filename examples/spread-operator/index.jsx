          The spread operator <Code>...</Code> takes an iterable and expands it into the individual elements.
          The spread operator looks identical to the rest operator but instead performs the opposite action.
          <Playground codeText={a} es6Console={true} scope={{}} />
        </p>
        <p>
          This is most useful for dealing with cases like <Code>apply</Code> where you want to pass an iterable as its components.
          In fact, <Code>apply</Code> is no longer needed to pass an array as arguments.
          <Playground codeText={b} es6Console={true} scope={{}} />
        </p>
        <p>
          Spread syntax works with any iterable object, including arrays and instances of <Code>Map</Code> and <Code>Set</Code>.
          <Playground codeText={c} es6Console={true} scope={{}} />
        </p>
      </div>
